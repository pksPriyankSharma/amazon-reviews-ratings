# Problem statement for Large Language Model
# The user review data has to be downloaded from the given repository
# A Model has to be built using Basic steps, which can help predict the Rating for given Review
# The embeddings can be used for any of the provider, like Universal Sentence Encoder or OpenAI
# The review data handling, processing the embeddings, Building the Model should be done in a way:
#     : the usage of Memory is low
#     : the Model can be built and run with given basic resources of google colab notebook, and without deploying any high end server
#     : the time taken in different steps should not overshoot and become unacceptable
#     : using Batch processing, iteratively is preferred
#     : using cache is preferred
#     : the Model should be saved for future, and not to be built again
#     : the embeddings also should be saved, to avoid downloading again, saving cost
